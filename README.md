# Hex MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides real-time Hex package version information to AI tools like Cursor. This service helps ensure that AI-assisted development uses the correct and most up-to-date package versions when adding dependencies to Elixir projects.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). Think of it like a USB-C port for AI applications. For more information about MCP, visit the [official documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

## Using with Cursor

Cursor supports MCP servers out of the box. To get accurate Hex package version suggestions in your Elixir projects, add this server to your Cursor configuration.

### Server URL

```
https://hex-mcp.9elements.com/sse
```

For detailed setup instructions, visit the [Cursor MCP documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#model-context-protocol).

## Development Setup

To start your Phoenix server locally:

1. Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
2. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
3. Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser

In order to allow the specific sites, adjust your `/etc/hosts` like this:

```
127.0.0.1	hex-mcp.localhost
127.0.0.1	gem-mcp.localhost
127.0.0.1	npm-mcp.localhost
```
